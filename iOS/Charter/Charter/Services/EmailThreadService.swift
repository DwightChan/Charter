        // There's an unfortunate side effect to using Realm where I don't think we can create emails without putting them into a realm because of the ways that `descendants`, `references`, and `inReplyTo` work. This means that the network data source has the additional responsibility of putting retrieved objects into the Realm. We can work around this by creating a new network model that a `EmailThreadNetworkDataSource` can return that has references/descendants/inReplyTo as strings rather than Email references, and then we should add a method to the `EmailThreadCacheDataSource` to cache emails that are in this format. Let's make this a todo.
        // TODO: Remove side effects from the network data source
        
        // There are some issues when we make a request for the same emails twice--we need to add upsert-ability. (This is another reason we need to draw out these responsibilities.)
        // TODO: Add upsert for the network data source caching
