## Details

**How do I run the project?**

1. `git clone https://github.com/matthewpalmer/MailingListParser`
2. `pod install`
3. Run the app in Xcode

**Is this good? Is the code for this good?**

Definitely not. I'm working on it.

**Is this available on the App Store?**

It will be soon, but I’m sick of waiting for the app store to approve it, so I figured I’d just post it.

**Can I contribute?**

Of course! However, I will say this: I didn’t intend to open source this so early, so the project’s pretty messy,
and it’s going to change pretty quickly over the coming weeks. It might not be the best use of your time to do it *right now*,
but open an issue and we can track it.

**What's next?**

I’ll be tracking what I’m working on in the issues for this repo, but roughly

* Add a backend so we can get faster list updates (and open source it)
* Clean up the front end codebase
* Add new features
