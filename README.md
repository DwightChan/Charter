## Details

**How do I run the project?**

1. `git clone https://github.com/matthewpalmer/Charter`
2. `pod install`
3. Run the app in Xcode

**Is this available on the App Store?**

Yep—[Charter on the App Store](https://itunes.apple.com/us/app/charter-mailing-list-client/id1082212697?ls=1&mt=8). You’re welcome to download from the App Store or build it yourself, whatever’s easiest.

**Can I contribute?**

Of course! However, I will say this: I didn’t intend to open source this so early, so the project’s pretty messy,
and it’s going to change pretty quickly over the coming weeks. It might not be the best use of your time to do it *right now*,
but open an issue and we can track it.

**What’s next?**

I’m going to be trying to do the whole [Artsy](http://artsy.net) “Open Source by Default” thing, so I’ll mainly track what’s coming up in the GitHub issues for this repo, but roughly

* Add a backend so we can get faster list updates (and open source it)
* Clean up the front end codebase so it's easier for others to contribute
* The usual: bug fixes and new features
