libedit probably isn't available on iOS, but it's only used by the compiler-debugging REPL. You can refine the #if here to exclude it from iOS builds:

#if defined(__APPLE__) || defined(__FreeBSD__)
// FIXME: Support REPL on non-Apple platforms. Ubuntu 14.10's editline does not
// include the wide character entry points needed by the REPL yet.
#include <histedit.h>
#endif // __APPLE__

Instead of defined(__APPLE__), defined(__MACOSX__) is probably more appropriate.
