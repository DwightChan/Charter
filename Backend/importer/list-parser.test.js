Note that some of these files are not formatted correctly within each message.
Namely, they are missing indentation for stuff like `references` and multi-line
`subject`s. I've deliberately tried to avoid asserting too much about the actual
content of each message (since that is the domain of the message-parser module).
This might come back to bite us.
